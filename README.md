# Proteintools
The aim of this project is to provide a set of scripts useful in structural biology. To use, copy a script into the directory with your data and ammend as required. The database directory contains an example schema for the organisation of structural biological data. Scripts are categorised by:
* cloningscripts - A set of tools for DNA manipulation, blasting, and vector construction
* dockingscripts - For molecular dynamics simulations of the complex formation between two proteins
* sprscripts - For modelling and fitting SPR sensogram data and KD calculation
* plotscripts - Plotting data in matplotlib
* fittingscripts - Uses sympy and scipy to fit curves to data
* pyloscripts - For generation of phylogenetic maps using blast
* nmrscripts - For the processing of 3D protein structural NMR data and setup of ARIA over NMRbox
