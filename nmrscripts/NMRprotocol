--------------

Start by ejecting the previous sample
Inject your sample into the magnet
Lock onto your conditions
Tune the radio waves into the frequency of each of the atoms
Shim the sample until hz = 0.1 and 0.5
Use the xaua macro
fill this in more specifically at another time when your brain is not absolutely wasted
